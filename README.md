# Key Features
- **Weapon Overhaul** - A majority weapons are overhauled with realism & game balance in mind. This includes on-ground guns & vehicular weapons.
- **Increased Ped Defense** - All pedestrian defense stats are adapted with the weapon tweaks in mind. This results in the player & pedestrians taking roughly the same amount of damage.
- **More Weapons** - Most beta weapons have been added. They spawn naturally as well. This includes: SPAS-12, Revolver, Wooden Bat, & Pool Cue.
- **More Animations** - Tons of animations are restored & implemented. Peds can attempt to crawl away, hold onto their wounds, & much more.
- **Blood Impact Flash** - The screen will now flash red when the player's health is damaged. This will not occur when you have armor.
- **Blood Enhancements** - More blood effects can be seen. Most prominently is a bleeding/blood drool effect on both the player & NPCs.
- **Fixed Animiations** - Various animations for guns are fixed & improved.
- **Responsive Movement** - Various animations are also spliced or sped up, resulting in movement feeling more responsive & fast-paced.
- **Bullet Penetration** - Tons of materials in the world such as glass, wood, & plastic are able to be shot through.
- **Weapon Variety** - More weapons will spawn on pedestrians. This is best seen on Police, N.O.o.S.E, & FIB, who can now spawn with Pump Shotguns, SPAS-12's, & even grenade launchers (TBoGT exclusive.) The previously mentioned beta weapons will also spawn naturally with this.
- **Improved Melee Ped Combat** - The pedestrians now have access to the player's melee capability. This means peds can now: counter-attack, dodge, steal your weapons, & backstab you.
- **Extras** - Assault Rifle Drive-by with convertibles is now possible & drive-bying with SMGs is fixed.
